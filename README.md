# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The school board has notified that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards. This analysis will replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High Schill with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. With these scores replaced the school district analysis will be performed again and this report will describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
